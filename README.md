# Introduction  
Accurate forecasting of household electricity consumption is vital for smart grid management and energy planning.  
Using the **Smart Meters in London** dataset with household usage, weather, and calendar features, we apply a **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** model to predict daily electricity demand.  
Results show improved accuracy over traditional time-series methods, highlighting the potential of deep learning for reliable household-level load forecasting.
